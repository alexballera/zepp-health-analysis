# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**⚠️ ALWAYS read and follow the instructions in [`/AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) before making any changes to this project.**

That file contains:
- Complete project context and user profile
- Architecture and data flow
- Code conventions and patterns
- Development workflows
- Project-specific decisions and reasoning

This indirection allows all AI agents (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to share the same comprehensive instructions.
